# Day of Rememberance

Every year AmeriCorps VISTAs step out of their offices and into direct community service on 9/11, participating in hundreds of projects nationwide. The National Day of Service honors a day of tragedy that resulted in a national and international coming together to help those most in need, seeking to remember the sacrifices made through making the world a better place, one day at a time.

It is strange to think that I am among the youngest people who can actually remember 9/11, a day that caused such a major shift in our world that an entire generation is growing up in a country redefined by a single day.

It was a really nice day out for mid September, sunny and warm. I was home that morning with my mom and brothers, getting ready for afternoon Kindergarten. I don't know whether the news had already been on or if my mom had gotten a call and turned it on, but I do remember those images, the same ones that get played every year of the smoke billowing out of the buildings, of them crumbling, of people jumping. I don't think I really understood what had happened, that a group of people had been filled with such hatred they set out to murder hundreds of civilians, but I understood the panic, the saddness, the confusion. While children may not be able to understand technicalities or international politics I believe they are capable of picking up on and understanding raw emotion better than most, and you don't ever forget feelings of that maginitude.

There was talk of closing schools, but in our small relatively safe Ohio town routine was the best anyone could do, so I went to school but even that was different. All the teachers kept the news on. Not all of it was appropriate for elementary school kids, but as the day unfolded there was a desperation to be informed, to know if just maybe there had been some mistake, or just to know how far the tragedy reached.

My brother William was 1 at the time, and Isaac was less than 3 months old. They will never know a world unmarked by those four planes. For them the airports have always had security checks, there has always been a War on Terror, movies have always been made with a different NYC skyline. I don't think they will truly ever understand the shift that happened on that day, the feeling of security that was crushed under the rubble of those towers. Maybe it is better to never know a world that is different, to never long for a time before the fear. But maybe there is danger in that too, maybe because you can't really understand a day you don't actually remember.
