# Day of Rememberance

Every year AmeriCorps VISTAs step out of their offices and into direct community service on 9/11, participating in hundreds of projects nationwide. The National Day of Service honors a day of tragedy that resulted in a national and international coming together to help those most in need, seeking to remember the sacrifices made through making the world a better place, one day at a time.

It is strange to think that I am among the youngest people who can actually remember 9/11, a day that caused such a major shift in our world that an entire generation is growing up in a country redefined by a single day.

It was a really nice day out for mid September, sunny and warm. I was home that morning with my mom and brothers, getting ready for afternoon Kindergarten. I don't know whether the news had already been on or if my mom had gotten a call and turned it on, but I do remember those images, the same ones that get played every year of the smoke billowing out of the buildings, of them crumbling, of people jumping. I don't think I really understood what had happened, that a group of people had been filled with such hatred they set out to murder hundreds of civilians, but I understood the panic, the saddness, the confusion. While children may not be able to understand technicalities or international politics I believe they are capable of picking up on and understanding raw emotion better than most, and you don't ever forget feelings of that maginitude.

There was talk of closing schools, but in our small relatively safe Ohio town routine was the best anyone could do, so I went to school but even that was different. All the teachers kept the news on. Not all of it was appropriate for elementary school kids, but as the day unfolded there was a desperation to be informed, to know if just maybe there had been some mistake, or just to know how far the tragedy reached.

My brother William was 1 at the time, and Isaac was less than 3 months old. They will never know a world unmarked by those four planes. For them the airports have always had security checks, there has always been a War on Terror, movies have always been made with a different NYC skyline. I don't think they will truly ever understand the shift that happened on that day, the feeling of security that was crushed under the rubble of those towers. Maybe it is better to never know a world that is different, to never long for a time before the fear. But maybe there is danger in that too, maybe because you can't really understand a day you don't actually remember.

# Working with Warriors

For our day of service it was difficult to think of where we should go, the project had to cover an entire day, hopefully be with one of our partners, and somehow tie back to 9/11. Luckily we had one program that really fit all of those needs. Workshops for Warriors.

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">[![Workshops for Warriors logo](https://workshopsforwarriors.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/workshop_for_warriors_logo2.png)](https://workshopsforwarriors.org/)</span>

Workshops is a job training program for veterans, wounded warriors, and end of service active duty members. Throughout a 16 week program participants have a change to gain anywhere between 5 to 25 certifications for welding and machienery. Most of them are then able to funnel directly into middle to high income positions at top notch manifacturing companies all across the country. Along with the hard skills Workshops also gives them the soft skills needed to  make the transition into civilian life smoother, from interview skills, to employer meet and greets, all right alongside other service members who really understand where they're coming from. 

Long story short it's a family (but if you want the long story click on the logo for more information). We were so lucky to go be a part of that family just for a day. You see it takes thousands of dollars to train one student, and these services are offered at no charge to them, sometimes they even get help with housing and living expenses while in the program. So it's a pretty expensive operation even just for a class of about 18 students every semester.

With a limited budget for staff there are a lot of things that have to be put on the back burner, and that's where we came in, for an entire day we did everything from call alumni for updated information and data entry, to cleaning signs and transcribing student testimonies. Now we really only made a dent in the work that could be done, but four extra workers for one day can accomplish a lot, and they gave us back even more.

We took a tour of the facility, saw their plans for their next expansion, and got to sit and talk with people who saw first hand every day how this program can change the lives and families of veterans for the better. (They also had dogs in the office so that was pretty awesome) I even made a connection with a company back home that has hired some of their graduates and is one of their big funders.

These men and women devoted their lives to service, not just a day or a year, but as a country we do very little to prepare them for what comes after, and programs like this are helping to fill that gap.

Working alongside those who have been through so much, but still give back every day to a cause they believe in is one of the best ways to remember a sacrifice. Looking at what happened all those years ago, and remembering all the pain it caused can open the door for bitterness, hatred, predjudice, and fear. But what if because we remembered, because we know that we have the ability to come together in unity after sucha  tragedy we all devoted our lives to a little bit more service. Even if that's just helping a neighbor or volunteering locally, it's a small act that can really make all the difference. Not just to remember, but to thrive.
