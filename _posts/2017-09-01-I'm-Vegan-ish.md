# Disclaimer - I'm not one of "those vegans"

I am not here to recruit you I promise. This isn't some huge testimonial where I'm going to flip it around at the end and try to turn you into some animal loving hippie Californian.

While I've embraced many ways of life here I still would not call myself a hippie by any means. In all honestly I don't really care if a chicken dies and gets fried up. My choice, my highly individual and personal choice, is about how I feel when I get up in the morning, the kind of energy I have, and how my purchase power affects the world I live in.

# The Struggle

I haven't been happy with my body for a while. Yes I was gaining weight but that wasn't the main problem. I felt sluggish and tired, my anxiety had reached an all time high my last year of college, and I couldn't seem to stop the physical or emotional rollercoaster of crappy feelings.

When I felt bad I would eat things that were "comforting", but then end up feeling worse than before, most of the time because my stomach hurt. I was withdrawn from my friends, and was not enjoying my life to the fullest I could be. The previous fall I had done some light jogging and yoga, but the couple months before graduation all of that stopped. I told myself I was busy and stressed and didn't need anything else on my plate, but in reality not having that time spent on me, refocusing my energy in my body, getting the blood flowing, it was doing more harm than the time I gained back was worth.

Beginning of summer I was by far at my heaviest, but something had changed. I had finally opened up to those close to me about hwo much I was hurting. My panic and anxiety about the future and whether or not I was good enough had crippled my ability to have genuine conversations about how I was feeling and any chance of asking for help.

# The Change

Then I moved to sunny California, I found an apartment, a job I love and [a whole lot more.](https://ebrowningsdpz.github.io/writing/2017/08/28/Welcome-to-the-West-Coast.html) But my life is too stressful for me not to opperating at my best on all fronts. I'm being forced to live in the present, which is great, but if I don't have the energy I'm not making the most out of my time here.

So I've made a couple changes, after getting settled I decided I needed something active, and luckily there is a fantastic yoga studio who offered me and my colleagues free classes because of our volunteer status.

I spend time every day out getting sun, even if its just a 15 minute walk on my lunch break.It's amazing what a little sunshine can do for your outlook.

I listen to podcasts or read on the bus. It's usually storytelling, but it's always about things I really enjoy, that even if they're sad are truly uplifting in their own way.

And finally I changed the way I ate. If nothing else going vegan forces me to cook more, be more aware of what goes in my cart at the grocery store, and I spend more positive time around food. There would be times before when I would just sit on the couch, mope, and eat a block of cheese instead of making dinner, but now I don't allow myself the time to fall into those bad habits again. If I get home from yoga and have to shop and cook and shower, usually all while listening to upbeat indie or the newest Moth Radio Hour, then I go to bed happy and satisfied.

The more time you fill with good things, even something as conscious resting to recover from a stressful day, and the less time you spend just trying to wallow in the bad there's a total change about how you look at your life when the bad things happen.

If there's a disagreement at the apartment, or I don't get along with someone at work, the quicker I can work through why I feel upset, try to see if from a different point of view, and accept what's out of my control, the less time the negative thoughts take up in my life.

# I'm a Bad vegan

So yes going vegan will probably help my pants fit a little better, yes my skin has cleared up significantly, and yes I do have more energy and spend less money on food in general, but as a whole going vegan has **nothing to do with food.** It has to do with my attitude, and my outlook.

Veganism for me is a discipline in my day to day life, which is probably why I'm going to be the last person to beat you over the head if you want a double bacon cheeseburger with extra animal fat. I'm even planning on breaking veganism for special occasions, and I'll be damned if I don't eat an entire cheesecake on my birthday. So that probably makes me a bad vegan, but I'm by far a better human for it.

So find what it is that makes you better, that challenges you, that gets you out of your headspace long enough to enjoy the world around you. For me it was changing how I ate and how I saw myself, and maybe later it'll be something else. But for now I am happily and unapologetically vegan-ish.
