Some things on this blog might look a little random. Like why did I have to add an interactive map to my food stamp blog? Or why is the Workshops for Warriors link awkwardly centered? The truth is this blog isn't as simple as it looks. 

While I have been using this as a personal sort of journal, I have also been using it as a playground as I learn how to code for a website. Cool right?!?! Now I haven't been doing it all on my own, because two months ago I would have had no idea where to start! And sometimes I still feel completely lost, but luckily I've got some great people here at my job willing to help me out.

It really started because my first week on the job I went out after work with my boss and this "random data guy" from the City. I mentioned that I had worked with system integration a little at my old job and really enjoyed the challenge. And this lead to the data guy, who I had by this point figured out was the City's Cheif Data Officer, asking if I'd like to come to a website development crashcourse he was leading. 

I said "sure, why not?"

This can be the three best words you say at a new job or the three worst. But as long as I am here I had decided to dive right in. We don't get paid a lot, but this year is going to pay me back in experience and broadened horizons. I had just never guessed that coding was going to be one of those horizons.

For a long time I have considered myself a pretty technologically inept person. My laptops primary purpose post college was Netflix and when things broke I just yelled at it and tried to ask the internet what went wrong. Turns out this is also most of what you do if you want to code, espeically the ask the internet part.

I also now know a little of how to internet works when you want to ask it something...

So I went to this training on a Monday morning and sat there thinking "I'm never going to be able to do any of this." 

Guess what? Two months later and I'm doing everything we learned that day and more. Some of the tricker things I've managed is that now you can subscribe to my site! I'm using MailChimp since my site can't actually store emails or generate emails. I now know what an RSS feed, and made one for my site. I've reformatted, and recolored the blog from its original form. And more than anything when I want to try something new I've been asking the internet!

There's still a ton I want to learn and a lot I'll screw up when I try it the first time. It took me almost a week to figure out why I had two instagram buttons instead of an instagram and a twitter... I'm still not totally sure how I fixed it.

But here's the thing, I took a leap moving and I've decided to not stop leaping. Getting out of my comfort zone and just saying "why not?" to a couple things has helped me make the most of the past few months. I'm someone who never in my life thought I would code. EVER. But here I am, building a website, sharing my stories, and I can't wait for more!
