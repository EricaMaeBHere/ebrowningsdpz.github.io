So I dropped the ball on this whole blogging thing, which is par for the course for me. I always love writing, but it comes in wild bursts full of ideas and then... nothing. I become overwhelmed by apathy for detailing everything I do online, really wondering why I bother. It's the same with journaling, I've never been a person who could sit down and do that every day, no matter how many nice journals or fun pens I aquire.

And New Year's doesn't help. Why is it that we decided that in the middle of winter, just coming out of the largest sugar and alcohol binge of our year is the time we have to start being these amazing ideal versions of ourselves?! I get people want to believe in new beginnings, and real change, and fresh starts. But just because it's January doesn't mean torturing yourself at the gym gets any easier, or giving up dairy sucks less.

Bettering ourselves is not an all or nothing choice. It's a constant thing we have to practice. It is *not* helpful to think overnight we can start a huge new undertaking. If you want to run a marathon this year you're not going to start with 20 miles. Go walk around the block for 30 minutes, and know that it is **okay**. You are, exactly where you are, and a new calendar coming out doesn't mean you have to be someone different.

If you really really want to make a resolution, if that change in the calendar is the boost you need, then fine. But don't frame your resolutions to make it seem like you've already failed. You're a work in progress and that's okay.

### How NOT to write a resolution
* "I will lose 20 lbs"
* "I will be in a relationship"
* "I will journal every day"

When you write these, you're not leaving any room for adjustment or forgiveness, and then when you drop the ball once you feel like all the work you accomplished was for nothing. Instead try something like this...

### How to write a Self Loving resolution
* "I will do more things that scare me"
* "I will listen more to how my body feels, and what it needs"
* "I will focus more on the moment, rather than the future or the past"

These types of resolutions still open the door for the weight loss or the relationship or the journaling, but the recognize the process. There is room for babystepts, and missteps, and if you really truly commit to these you may just be happier overall.

In 2017, the only resolution I made was "I will be less afraid to fail." I did this because coming out of college I wanted to see how far I could go, what I could accomplish, and I wasn't going to do that if I was worried I would fall short. We all fall short, but that doesn't mean we stop trying. I applied for jobs I was sure I wouldn't get(and got denied from most of them) I moved to a city I had never been to before, I decided to try coding, which I had no business doing, I went on awkward internet dates, I watched Lucha Libre fighting in Mexico, and each of these things has been exciting and difficult and way way better than any sort of goals I could've set, or imagined, for myself a year ago. 

This year I don't really have anything close to a resoltuion. But so far, I think I just want to spend more time focused on the people that matter. More phone calls, more meals, more of our lives being shared. This isn't happening because it's January, it's happening because more and more I realize that these things are what really matter, and I want to be a little better every day, no matter where it is on a calendar.
