Lets keep a record together of things we'll be doing today:

* Make a github account
* Go to [https://mrmaksimize/datasd_blog_starter](the blog starter repo page) and click fork.
* Go to settings, and change the name of the repository to [your-username].github.io
* open LXTerminal
* clone the repo, by opening your terminal typing in `git clone your_repo_name`
* enter the folder by saying `cd your_repo_name`
* `bundle install` to install your dependencies
* `jekyll serve --watch`
* start editing!
