In my life food stamps has always felt like a dirty word. Growing up in a conservative midwest town they were seen as something only lazy people needed. If you were smart enough and hard working enough then taking a government hand out didn't need to be an option.

So how am I supposed to feel now that I'm one of those people? But the thing is I'm not lazy or stupid, and I'm not trying to scam the government, and neither are 99.99% of people on them.

The first time I went up to use my food stamps was at a farmers market here in town that matches your CalFresh food stamps up to 10 extra dollars you can use at the market on produce. 

I knew that the people at the tent where you go to use your food stamps do this all the time, but I was still afraid of their judgement as I walked up. Would they think I was incompetent? Did I look too well off to need food stamps? (I was wearing a pair of overalls from the salvation army that only cost $3 by the way). Would they think I was silly for asking what kinds of foods I was allowed to buy? I was so nervous I almost didn't even go up and ask, but in the end I'm glad I did.

The guy who met with me was excited to have me there, and made sure right away as a first time food stamp user I knew everything, from which farmers markets matched my dollars to exactly what I could and couldn't buy.  He was friendly and interested in who I was and why I loved farmers markets. He really didn't care that I was on food stamps, he just wanted to help. I don't think he realized that with his kindness he helped calm a lot of self doubt I was having about what type of person I was asking for this kind of help.

If you want to go meet him and all the other awesome people trying to make farmers markets accessible to those struggling with poverty I've worked up this map of all the farmers markets in San Diego. The ones in the lightest pink will Market Match, medium pink accepts CalFresh, and dark pink does not accept them (which is really sad because the one next to my house doesn't accept them and I really wish they did)

Not that I've got it all figured out, but the longer I'm here in this job, the longer I'm living below the poverty line, the more I realize that the world is full of many more people who want to help, than those who want to judge. But I think the world also needs people to talk about it and help change the perspectives of those who think less of people on assistance programs.

I work 40 hours a week for our government working to reduce poverty, trying my best to make ends meet, just trying to make it through the month. I know part of AmeriCorps is getting this first hand experience of poverty, and I'm grateful for it opening my eyes to the daily reality of so many Americans who don't have access to living wage jobs.

I think for me it starts by speaking up at home when jokes are made by people I love, friends and family, who don't mean to cause harm but are still spreading false ideas with their words. Maybe if they see me, someone they know and love, someone who works hard and gives back and defies many of their pre conceived notions opening up about going on Food Stamps during this time in my life something can change. The fear of judgement is still there but I have no shame about asking for help.
