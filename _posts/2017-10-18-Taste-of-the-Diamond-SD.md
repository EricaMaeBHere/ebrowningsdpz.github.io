My life has recently fallen into a rythm, which is a good thing sometimes. I no longer feel like a total stranger to this city. I have friends I hang out with regularly. I even feel fairly accustomed to my job. The problem is it hasn't led to much inspiration to blog. By the time I get home I'm exhausted from meetings and deadlines, and this sweltering heat. No one told me we'd still be hitting 100 degrees in October!

I had gotten so caught up in trying to get everything done I needed to that I wasn't having a lot of fun with it. Lucky for me I don't have a job that keeps me trapped behind a desk every day so there are plenty of opportunities for inspiration to sneak back in. This time it happened on a day I was not looking forward to. I was in charge of leading a team of San Diego State students conducting a community perception survey in the Promise Zone. It meant that I was going to be at work from 9 a.m. till 9 p.m. and I was not a happy camper.

I had just gotten out of a normal day of meetings which drain you mentally, and I was going to have to survey random people, keep college students in line, and not be home or having dinner till at least 10. I was grumpy to say the least. The good people of Southeastern really put me in my place. We were going to the Taste of the Diamond, a food festival for the neighborhood. In reality it's about twenty tents and a stage in a Big Lots parking lot, but from the first person I talked to I was enthralled.

The woman who organized it not only had heard about the Promise Zone but was so excited we were there! She gave me her card and chatted for a while about what they were trying to do and her excitement was contagious.

Soon I was surrounded by people I worked with from all different partner organizations across the city. We were sharing food, attempting to Zumba, and having real conversations about their hopes and concerns for their community, not just what was asked in the survey. Veggie sliders from one of our partners, Kitchens for Good were to die for (their drunk mustard is one of my favorite condiments on the planet). 

There was another restaurant that was trying to raise money to come back to the area where they had started. It was this amazing soul food place that had spicy fried catfish, mac and cheese, and corn muffins that immediately made you feel warm in the heart.

I looked around this community and many of us were different, we grew up in different places, had different incomes and different politics. But at this moment we had two very big things in common, we loved food and we loved this neighborhood. I realized that this is why I took this job, this is why I put up with 12 hour days, and being exhausted and starting projects just to have them thrown out and started over. I took it because this community is an amazing place, and more people need to see that.

The neighborhoods south of the 94 are some of the best kept secrets in San Diego, and I've come to love these people, they have challenges but there's so much more to them than that. When they come together they are a spot of joy and comfort even when, like me, you're a long was from home.
