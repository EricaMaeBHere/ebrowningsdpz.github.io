![Homeless tents San Diego News Clip](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/homelessness/94604777-132.html)

In case you hadn't heard, San Diego is in a bit of a crisis. The City is seeing the largest outbreak of Hepatitis A since the discovery of the vaccine, which is to say A LOT! There have been 544 cases, 20 of which proving to be deadly. And making the streets smell like a public swimming pool by washing them in bleach doesn't seem to be helping.

Hep A, for all my friends who aren't living in a city where it's gone rampant, is caused by an ingestion of fecal matter, and for all intensive pourposes is like the stomach flu on steriods waging war against your liver. So imagine 544 TURNING YELLOW, and suffering from uncontrollable... most bodily functions. And like almost everything awful to hit our society, guess who it hits the hardest? Ding ding ding! You guessed it! The homeless.

What's really awful about this epidemic is that for all the politicians talk about trying to find a solution for homelessness, it took them dying on a massive scale for any sort of measures to be pushed forward... Measures, by the way, that are also being questioned for their actual helpfulness.

For the time being San Diego has decided that the best course of action will be giant tents, three of them, and two out of the three are being put up in the Promise Zone. This is not going over so well. Barrio Logan and the East Village have a long history with the homeless and the City making decisions without consulting community leaders or residents. The issue isn't the homeless who will be inside of the tents, it's everyone they attract to hang out around the tents. If you want to read in detail... [here's the letter they wrote to the mayor](https://sandiegofreepress.org/2017/11/letter-to-mayor-faulconer-on-the-temporary-shelters-in-barrio-logan-east-village/)

I really don't have much else to say, they sum it up pretty expertly. What is really concerning is that with the way homeless have been pushed about by development over the last several years, is that no one saw this coming. It's sad for it to seem like most people don't care that the homeless are put at a much higher risk for these types of crises until it becomes large enough to effect people who aren't homeless. I don't think I have a solution, and I know I'm new to the city, but right now for me it is an issue of society wide apathy for a group of people who are in need of the most of our empathy.
