![Homeless tents San Diego News Clip](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/homelessness/94604777-132.html)

In case you hadn't heard, San Diego is in a bit of a crisis. The City is seeing the largest outbreak of Hepatitis A since the discovery of the vaccine, which is to say A LOT! There have been 544 cases, 20 of which proving to be deadly. And making the streets smell like a public swimming pool by washing them in bleach doesn't seem to be helping.

Hep A, for all my friends who aren't living in a city where it's gone rampant, is caused by an ingestion of fecal matter, and for all intensive pourposes is like the stomach flu on steriods waging war against your liver. So imagine 544 TURNING YELLOW, and suffering from uncontrollable... most bodily functions. And like almost everything awful to hit our society, guess who it hits the hardest? Ding ding ding! You guessed it! The homeless.

What's really awful about this epidemic is that for all the politicians talk about trying to find a solution for homelessness, it took them dying on a massive scale for any sort of measures to be pushed forward... Measures, by the way, that are also being questioned for their actual helpfulness.
