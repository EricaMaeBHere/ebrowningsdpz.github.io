> What you are afraid to do is a clear indication of the next thing you need to do.
> -Ralph Waldo Emerson

Ohio born and bred, I've spent the few short years of my adult life diving head first into new adventures and exploring this crazy world of ours. 

Recently graduated from Olivet Nazarene University, just south of Chicago with a degree in Political Science. After spending a semester abroad studying at University of Oxford I knew I just couldn't sit still!

My passions for creative community based poverty relief, government, and travel all brought me to where I am today serving as an AmeriCorps VISTA member with the San Diego Promise Zone. Being an AmeriCorps member means pledging a year of my life to civil service and living at the local poverty level alongside the communities I'm serving. 

Combine that with the fact that I'm thousands of miles away from home at my first "adult" job ever and it's going to be a wild ride! Stick around for updates as I see where this crazy year in good old California takes me!
