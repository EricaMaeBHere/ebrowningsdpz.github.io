# What this is
This is a starter kit for a simple blog.  Very simple so as not to be overwhelming for newbies.

# Where to get help
* [Jekyll Site](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Google!

# How to improve this
* Add an _include for google analytics
* Add atom.xml for RSS feeds

# How to work on it
* Make a github account
* Go to [https://mrmaksimize/datasd_blog_starter](the blog starter repo page) and click fork.
* Go to settings, and change the name of the repository to [your-username].github.io
* open Terminal
* clone the repo, by opening your terminal typing in `git clone your_repo_name`
* enter the folder by saying `cd your_repo_name`
* `bundle install` to install your dependencies
* `jekyll serve --watch`
* start editing!

# Git workflow
* `git fetch origin` - check if anything new is up there
* `git merge origin/master` - pull in the new changes!
* make your edits - like lining up people in a photo!
* `git add -p` -- like telling people to freeze before taking a photo
* `git commit -m "A full sentence message that ends in a full stop"` - taking the picture
* `git push origin {the branch you're on}` - send your stuff up to github!
* when you feel like ready, make a pull request with Master as base, and your branch as compare!
